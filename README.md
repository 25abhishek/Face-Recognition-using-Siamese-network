# Face-Recognition-using-Siamese-network
## OVERVIEW
Siamese networks are a special type of neural network architecture. Instead of a model learning to classify its inputs, the neural networks learns to differentiate between two inputs. It learns the similarity between them.
## ARCHITECTURE
A Siamese networks consists of two identical neural networks, each taking one of the two input images. The last layers of the two networks are then fed to a contrastive loss function , which calculates the similarity between the two images.
